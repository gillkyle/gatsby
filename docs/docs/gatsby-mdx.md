title: Gatsby MDX API
---

Gatsby supports using MDX for adding the ability to embed components in markdown via `gatsby-plugin-mdx`. The MDX plugin is a fully featured MDX transformer, runtime, and ecosystem integration for ambitious projects. It integrates MDX with Gatsby to enable rich JAMStack applications. Using `gatsby-plugin-mdx`, you can build [interactive software documentation sites](/docs/mdx/interactive-code-blocks/), [apply design system components](/docs/mdx/customizing-components/) to rendered markdown, and more.

## Querying MDX Content via GraphQL

MDX files that are sourced via `gatsby-source-filesystem` can be queried through the GraphQL data layer.

Like `gatsby-transformer-remark`, `gatsby-plugin-mdx` adds fields to the MDX node like `wordCount` and `timeToRead` for convenience.
The following fields are added to each MDX node:

- `frontmatter`
- `exports`
- `rawBody`
- `fileAbsolutePath`
- `code`
- `excerpt`
- `headings`
- `html`
- `tableOfContents`
- `timeToRead`
- `wordCount`

The `exports` field is special in that all static exports – values that would be valid JSON – from a `.mdx` file are queryable
through it. Adding this export:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```mdx{1,3}
export const metadata = {
  name: "World",
}

# Title

Some content here
```

```jsx{1,3}
export const metadata = {
  name: "World",
}

# Title

Some content here
```

```graphql {1-3}
query MDXQuery {
  allMdx {
    edges {
      node {
        parent {
          ... on File {
            name
            absolutePath
            relativePath
          }
        }
        timeToRead
        frontmatter {
          title
        }
        exports {
          author
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: all fields can also be found and [queried](/docs/introducing-graphiql/) in your site's autogenerated GraphQL schema

MDX files sourced via `gatsby-source-filesystem` can be queried with
`allMdx` on the root query.

```graphql
query MDXQuery {
  allMdx {
    edges {
      node {
        parent {
          ... on File {
            name
            absolutePath
            relativePath
          }
        }
        timeToRead
        frontmatter {
          title
        }
        exports {
          author
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Accessing Parents

MDX Nodes typically have a parent source.
